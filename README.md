# PhoneGap-xml-generator
An application that simplify your steps towards creating an App xml and preparation of icons/splash screen images.

## Why I need this
Have you ever want to build your smartphone app however you find your photoshop skills is really limited and feeling troublesome to create so many icons and splash screen with so many different resolutions and filenames?
Here is the software that help you do all the stuffs. Just tick all the xml parts you want, modify the required value, click export, then your xml is done!

Oh, by the way, this software also contain features like converting a big image into different size splash screens and icons. But , you know, .NET framework works different on different version of Windows. Use with your own risk :)

Just tick the items you want to put into the xml file, modify the line in the textbox or element editor(right window), then you are ready to create your xml file.
Actually the uppermost textbox do nothing, all things generated within the base directory of this application.
However, this textbox might be useful in the future so I just keep it here.

To modify or add in new sizes, just open this project with Visual Studio and add the items into the listbox with the correct format.
